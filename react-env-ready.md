# How to Get React Environment Ready
## Requirements
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## Install `create-react-app`

Install `create-react-app` by running this command in your terminal:
```
npm install -g create-react-app
```
where `-g` stands for global. That means you can use it for creating React applications without installing it for your specific project.

You are now ready to create your first React application!

## Create Your React Applications
* Create a project through react command

Run this command to create a React application named `my-first-project`:
```
npx create-react-app my-first-project
```
The `create-react-app` will set up everything you need to run a React application.

* `cd` to your project directory called `my-first-project`.
```
cd my-first-project
```

* Execute the React application
```
npm start
```
A new browser window will pop up with your newly created React App! If not, open your browser and type localhost:3000 in the address bar.

The result:
